            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                It is estimated that around 500 million Africans do not have access to electricity, and globally, approximately 1.6 billion people lack reliable access to electricity. This lack of electricity hampers daily activities, limits educational opportunities, and hinders economic development. In such regions, innovative and cost-effective solutions are needed to bridge this energy gap. The Mud Battery could serve as a small-scale, temporary measure to provide basic lighting and power for communities in need, helping to improve their quality of life and fostering a sense of resourcefulness and empowerment.
